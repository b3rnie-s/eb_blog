# Hi, I'm Eli

I'm a product generalist who has spent the past 10 years helping startups build stuff people want.

Today, I lead product at [Ascertain](www.ascertain.com) where we're building agentic systems for healthcare. In the past I've worked on [medical devices (hardware and SaMD)](https://optainhealth.com/), [marketplaces](https://torchdental.com/), [business intelligence platforms](https://seatgeek.com/enterprise), and [mobile apps](https://www.forbes.com/sites/annefield/2023/08/09/sallie-mae-buys-key-assets-of-scholarship-app-scholly/).

**I like:**

- Walkable cities and public transportation
- Systems that encourage risk-taking / safety nets
- Multiplayer games
- Breakfast burritos
- Skiing

Please say hello. You can usually find me in Brooklyn, NY or through either of the below:
