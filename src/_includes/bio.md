# Welcome

I'm an interface researcher interested in how technology can support deeper understanding and expand human creative capacity.

I've done research at NYU focused on *creativity support tools*, developed interfaces at Midjourney and worked as an interaction designer alongside Hugh Dubberly.

With Andy Matuschak, we designed [Latticework](#), a text editing environment aimed to help people synthesize freeform, unstructured documents.

If my work resonates with you, this is a standing invitation to reach out!
